# Survey Filling App

![This is a alt text.](./src/img/Survey.jpg "This is a sample image.")

## Description

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/survey](http://localhost:3000/survey) to view it in the browser.
to display the surveys for mentors or companies, you must put the mentor id or the
company id after "survey/" in the URL.

The page will reload if you update the components.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The mentors and the companies will access through an URL that was sent to their e-mail.

### Installing Packets
`npm install axios`
`npm install react-card-flip`
`npm install antd`
`npm install react-custom-scrollbars`
`npm install react-router-dom`

These are all the packets needed to run and build the app.

### Functional Components

Most of this aplication was built as a SPA(single page application) made of functional components
with useState and useEffect hooks.



The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
